# Nene.js - GitHub Copilot Instructions

> See `AI_CONTEXT.md` in the project root for full project context, structure, and patterns.

## Key Rules

- **NEVER duplicate types.** Always import from `@nene/shared`.
- Read `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` before making structural changes.
- Update `docs/API.md` when adding/modifying endpoints.
- Update `docs/PROGRESS.md` to reflect progress.
- Run `pnpm build` to verify shared package changes work.
