Today, we're thrilled to announce **nene.js** - a revolutionary approach to full-stack TypeScript development.

## The Problem

Modern web development requires managing two separate worlds:

- **Backend**: APIs, validation, database queries
- **Frontend**: State management, data fetching, type synchronization

Developers spend countless hours keeping these worlds in sync, writing boilerplate code, and debugging type mismatches.

<Callout type="info">
  According to our research, developers spend up to 30% of their time on
  boilerplate code that bridges frontend and backend.
</Callout>

## Our Solution

nene.js introduces a **unified development experience** where:

1. You write your API once using decorators
2. Type-safe React hooks are generated automatically
3. Context is shared seamlessly between frontend and backend

```typescript
@Controller("/api/users")
export class UserController {
  @Get("/:id")
  async getUser(@Param("id") id: string) {
    return await this.userService.findById(id);
  }
}
```

That's it. The frontend hook `useUser({ id })` is generated automatically with full type safety.

## Key Features

### Automatic Hook Generation

No more writing fetch calls or managing loading states manually:

```tsx
const { data, isLoading, error } = useUser({ id: "123" });
```

### End-to-End Type Safety

Types flow from your backend to frontend automatically. Change a type in your controller, and TypeScript catches mismatches everywhere.

### Unified Context

Share authentication, locale, and custom data between frontend and backend without manual synchronization.

## Getting Started

Install nene.js and create your first project:

```bash
npx create-nene@latest my-app
cd my-app
npm run dev
```

Check out our [documentation](/docs/en/getting-started/installation) for a complete guide.

## What's Next

We're just getting started. Here's what's coming:

- Real-time subscriptions with WebSocket support
- Built-in caching with intelligent invalidation
- Visual API explorer and documentation
- Plugin system for extending functionality
