# Codex Rules

> See `AI_CONTEXT.md` for full project context, structure, and patterns.

## Key Rules

- **NEVER duplicate types.** Always import from `@app/shared`.
- Read `docs/overview/ARCHITECTURE.md` before making structural changes.
- Read `docs/kanban/README.md` for current task priorities.
- Update `docs/API.md` when adding/modifying endpoints.
- Move completed tasks in `docs/kanban/` (DOING -> DONE).
- Run `pnpm build` to verify shared package changes work.
